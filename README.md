# AWSome-Serverless:-
### In this repository I am uploading my learning approach for Serverless Computing and different Serverless Services and how to work with them. 
### This repository will help anyone who wanted to get started with Serveless using AWS and wanted to master it.

## Learning Path Agenda of Complete Repository:-

### What is serverless computing:-
* What is serverless computing and how does it work?
* What are the building blocks of serverless computing?
* How do people use serverless function in design?

### Creating a RESTful API using Amazon API Gateway:-
* Defining a model for the API
* Define resources for the model
* Add a method for clients to access the resources

### Connect your first serverless function using AWS Lambda:-
* Implement a serverless function with AWS Lambda
* Connect our lambda function up ton our API Gateway

### Using Serverless function:-
* Read values from a Lambda function using an API Gateway endpoint
* Monitor an S3 bucket and trigger a file conversion with a lambda function
* Use AWS Lambda function in an application 
* Monitor and debug Lambda fuction using AWS CloudWatch
