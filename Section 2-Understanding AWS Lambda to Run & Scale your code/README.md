- **Monitoring and Troubleshooting AWS Lambda:-**
  * The options available to you when monitoring your lambda and some of the common problems that arises when running your function and what to check.

## What will you gain after competing this section:-
* Explains what AWS Lambda is and what it is used for.
* Define the components used within Lambda
* Explains the different elements of a lambda function through its creations
* Understand the key difference between policies used within lambda
* Understand how events source and event mapping are managed for both synchronous and asynchronous invocations
* Use Amazon Cloud watch to monitor matrices and logs to issolate issues with your features
* Check for common errors that might be cousing your functions to fails

## An overview of AWS Lambda
